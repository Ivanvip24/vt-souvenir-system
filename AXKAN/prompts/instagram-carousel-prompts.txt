AXKAN INSTAGRAM CAROUSEL PROMPTS - "PORTAL A MÉXICO"
================================================================================
Created: December 2024
Purpose: AI Image Generation (Gemini, Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.)
Products: Magnets / Souvenirs
================================================================================


================================================================================
SLIDE 1: THE HOOK - "COLISIÓN DE MUNDOS"
================================================================================
Format: 1080x1350 portrait (Instagram optimal)
Purpose: Stop the scroll, create "WTF is this?" moment

PROMPT:
--------
Epic conceptual artwork, 1080x1350 portrait format, cinematic 8K quality.

DRAMATIC DIAGONAL COLLISION - two realities smashing together:

LEFT SIDE (AXKAN BRAND UNIVERSE):
- Flat hot pink (#e72a88) background with subtle noise texture
- Bold geometric Mayan grecas patterns in cyan (#09adc2) and orange (#f39223)
- An ILLUSTRATED jaguar in AXKAN brand style - stylized with geometric patterns inside its body, fierce pose, mid-leap toward the center
- Flat vector monstera leaves, hibiscus flowers, and spiral motifs
- The decorative AXKAN jaguar logo floating, glowing slightly
- Clean, bold, graphic illustration style - like the brand manual

RIGHT SIDE (REAL MEXICAN WORLD):
- Lush REAL photograph of Yucatan cenote - crystal turquoise water, dramatic limestone walls, hanging vines, roots reaching down, dappled sunlight
- A REAL jaguar drinking at the water's edge, photorealistic National Geographic quality, water droplets on its whiskers
- Real tropical vegetation with morning dew
- Volumetric light rays piercing through the jungle canopy
- Full photographic depth and richness

THE COLLISION ZONE (explosive diagonal center):
- The two worlds VIOLENTLY MERGE with kinetic energy
- The illustrated jaguar's front half TRANSFORMS into the real jaguar - fur materializing from flat color, muscles forming from shapes
- Vector leaves BECOME real leaves mid-transformation, visible pixel-to-organic transition
- Hot pink energy particles and cyan lightning bolts crackling at the collision line
- Fragments of both worlds floating - some illustrated shapes, some real leaves
- Motion blur streaks showing the force of collision
- Chromatic aberration effect at the impact zone

FLOATING AT THE EXACT COLLISION POINT:
A YUCATAN souvenir magnet - containing BOTH illustration AND photography inside it, as if it captured this exact moment of fusion. The magnet has a subtle glow, implying it's the SOURCE of this collision.

DYNAMIC COMPOSITION: Diagonal runs from bottom-left to top-right, 35-degree angle. Energy flows upward.

TEXT (bottom, elegant):
"DONDE LA IMAGINACIÓN SE VUELVE RECUERDO"
Small: @axkan.mx

Cinematic color grade: teals and magentas. Dramatic contrast. This is a movie poster moment.


================================================================================
SLIDE 2: THE REVELATION - "DESCOMPOSICIÓN CULTURAL"
================================================================================
Format: 1080x1350 portrait
Purpose: Show the intelligence and craft behind the product

PROMPT:
--------
Ultra-premium technical visualization, 1080x1350 portrait, luxury product photography style.

Background: Seamless gradient - pure white at top transitioning to soft warm gray at bottom. Subtle paper texture. Clean, editorial, Apple-level aesthetic.

CENTER COMPOSITION: A "COZUMEL" souvenir magnet displayed in EXPLODED ISOMETRIC VIEW - all component layers dramatically separated and floating in 3D space.

THE LAYERS (from back to front, each floating 3cm apart with crisp shadows):

LAYER 1 - FOUNDATION (deepest):
Real underwater photograph of Cozumel coral reef - vibrant corals, tropical fish, light rays through water. Slightly soft focus. This is "the inspiration."

LAYER 2 - ENVIRONMENT:
Illustrated tropical foliage layer - monstera, palm fronds, jungle leaves in flat colors (greens #8ab73b). Cut to match magnet shape. Semi-transparent edges.

LAYER 3 - LIFE:
The character elements floating - realistic sea turtle on left, stylized jaguar on right, small tropical fish scattered. These float at slightly different heights for depth.

LAYER 4 - IDENTITY:
The colorful "COZUMEL" letters floating - each letter a different brand color with Mayan tribal patterns visible inside. C-O-Z-U-M-E-L spread slightly apart, casting individual shadows.

LAYER 5 - HERITAGE:
A semi-transparent layer showing Mayan geometric grecas pattern - the cultural DNA overlay. Ghost-like, sacred geometry floating.

LAYER 6 - CRAFT (frontmost):
The MDF wood frame - the physical shell/edge piece, scalloped cloud shape like a cookie cutter. Warm tan wood tone (#D4A574), visible grain texture, thickness evident.

CONNECTING ELEMENTS:
- Thin elegant GOLD LINES (0.5pt) connecting corresponding points between layers, showing assembly logic
- Small golden circles at connection points like technical blueprints
- Subtle golden particles floating between layers

ANNOTATIONS (thin elegant sans-serif, warm gray color):
Delicate lines pointing to each layer with text:
- "FOTOGRAFÍA REAL" → reef photo
- "FLORA TROPICAL" → foliage layer
- "FAUNA EMBLEMÁTICA" → animals
- "TIPOGRAFÍA ARTESANAL" → letters
- "HERENCIA MAYA" → pattern layer
- "MADERA NATURAL" → wood frame

LIGHTING: Soft studio lighting from top-left. Each layer casts a crisp shadow on the layer below. The floating creates dramatic depth.

BOTTOM TEXT:
"CADA PIEZA. CADA CAPA. CADA DETALLE."
Small AXKAN logo in gold.

This feels like Dyson or Bang & Olufsen advertising - technical beauty revealed.


================================================================================
SLIDE 3: THE IMMERSION - "INMERSIÓN LÍQUIDA"
================================================================================
Format: 1080x1350 portrait
Purpose: Emotional impact, surreal beauty

PROMPT:
--------
Surrealist luxury photography, 1080x1350 portrait, hyperrealistic cinematic quality.

THE SCENE: A "CANCÚN" souvenir magnet HALF-SUBMERGED in impossibly clear Caribbean water, creating a split-reality image.

ABOVE THE WATERLINE (top 45% of image):

Sky: Golden hour warmth - soft peachy clouds, that magical Mexican sunset light. Not harsh, dreamy.

The magnet's top half emerges from the water:
- Letters "CAN" crisp and vibrant above surface
- Colors saturated and warm in the sunset light
- Water beading on the magnet surface, droplets catching golden light
- The illustrated toucan's head above water, beak vivid orange

Atmosphere above:
- A real hummingbird (colibrí) hovering 10cm from the magnet, wings frozen mid-beat, iridescent green
- Soft out-of-focus palm fronds in the far background
- A single hibiscus petal floating on the water surface
- Lens flare from the setting sun, tasteful not overdone

THE WATER SURFACE (the horizon line):
- MIRROR-PERFECT reflection line cutting horizontally across the image
- Gentle concentric ripples emanating from where magnet breaks the surface
- The surface tension visible where magnet meets water - that slight meniscus curve
- Reflection of the sky on the water - peachy gold

BELOW THE WATERLINE (bottom 55% of image):

The underwater world - completely different reality:
- Deep turquoise Caribbean color (#09adc2 gradient to deeper teal)
- The magnet's bottom half REFRACTED through water - letters "CÚN" wavering, distorted
- Light caustics dancing across the magnet surface - those magical underwater light patterns
- The illustrated jaguar's body underwater, legs seeming to swim

Marine life:
- A small school of sergeant major fish (yellow and black stripes) swimming past the magnet
- A single spotted eagle ray gliding in the background, slightly out of focus
- Delicate sea fan coral in the bottom corner
- Tiny silver bubbles rising from below, catching light

Underwater atmosphere:
- Volumetric light rays penetrating from above, god rays effect
- Particles floating in the water - that underwater snow effect
- The sandy bottom barely visible in the deep background, with ripple patterns

THE MAGIC:
The magnet exists in BOTH worlds simultaneously. Above: warm, air, golden. Below: cool, water, cyan. The product is the bridge between realities.

COLOR GRADE: Split - warm orange/gold tones above waterline, cool teal/cyan below. The contrast is the drama.

TEXT: None on this slide. Let the image breathe. The surrealism speaks.

This should feel like a Vogue editorial meets nature documentary. Impossible beauty that makes people FEEL something.


================================================================================
SLIDE 4: THE PORTAL - "PORTAL DIMENSIÓN" (HERO SHOT)
================================================================================
Format: 1080x1350 portrait
Purpose: The money shot, maximum impact

PROMPT:
--------
Hyper-realistic 3D cinematic composite, 1080x1350 portrait, movie poster quality.

BACKGROUND:
Deep space black with ultra-subtle gradient to dark teal (#0a2a2f) at the bottom. Not flat black - has depth, like looking into an abyss. Tiny distant stars barely visible.

CENTER - THE MAGNET AS PORTAL:

A "TULUM" souvenir magnet floating in the center, but it's RUPTURING OPEN - cracking like an egg, like a dimensional breach.

The magnet shell:
- The scalloped cloud shape is CRACKING - golden light bleeding through the fractures
- Edges of the crack have golden/amber energy glow
- The illustrated surface is fragmenting, pieces floating away
- Some fragments frozen mid-explosion, others drifting
- The crack runs diagonally across the magnet

ERUPTING FROM INSIDE THE PORTAL (layered in 3D space):

Closest to viewer (foreground):
- Caribbean water POURING out like liquid frozen in time - turquoise splash tendrils reaching toward camera
- Individual water droplets suspended in air, catching light
- A realistic sea turtle swimming TOWARD the viewer, emerging from the portal, half in/half out
- Tropical fish (blue tangs, angelfish) scattered in 3D space at various distances
- Pink and orange hibiscus petals swirling outward

Mid-ground:
- Real palm fronds and monstera leaves BURSTING from the crack
- A toucan mid-flight, wings spread, emerging from the magnet
- Ancient Mayan stone fragments floating - carved glyphs visible
- More water streams and mist

Inside the portal (visible through the crack):
- A glimpse of Tulum ruins on the cliff over turquoise sea
- Volumetric god rays streaming out
- The promise of an entire world inside

Background elements (behind the magnet):
- Energy wisps and particles swirling
- Subtle sacred geometry patterns in the void (very faint)
- More distant debris creating depth

LIGHTING:
- Primary light source: INSIDE the magnet, golden warm light blasting outward
- Rim lighting on all emerging elements - edges glowing
- Caustic water patterns projected onto floating elements
- Lens flare from the portal light, cinematic quality

PARTICLE EFFECTS:
- Golden energy particles streaming outward in spiral patterns
- Tiny water droplets everywhere, catching light
- Dust and debris adding atmosphere
- Subtle fog/mist at the edges

THE FEELING:
This is the MOMENT of magic - the instant where a simple souvenir cracks open and reveals it contains an ENTIRE WORLD. It's precious. It's impossible. It's Mexico captured in a magnet.

COLOR GRADE:
Teal and orange cinematic palette. Deep shadows, bright highlights. The golden light from the portal contrasts the cool dark void.

TEXT (bottom, cinematic movie-poster style):
"NO ES UN RECUERDO. ES UN PORTAL."
Small: AXKAN logo, subtle, bottom corner

This should look like concept art for a Marvel movie. Unreal Engine quality. The image that makes people SAVE the post.


================================================================================
SLIDE 5: THE COLLECTION - "PORTAL x3"
================================================================================
Format: 1080x1350 portrait
Purpose: Show variety, "There's more to discover"

PROMPT:
--------
Cinematic composite, 1080x1350 portrait, premium product photography.

BACKGROUND:
Rich dark gradient - deep charcoal (#1a1a1a) to dark teal (#0d3d3d). Subtle fog/atmosphere at the bottom.

COMPOSITION - THREE PORTALS:

Three destination magnets arranged in a triangular floating composition, each one a mini portal with elements escaping:

TOP CENTER - "YUCATÁN":
- Magnet glowing with green (#8ab73b) energy
- A realistic jaguar HEAD emerging, snarling, powerful
- Jungle vines and monstera leaves trailing out
- Mayan pyramid silhouette visible inside the glow
- Green energy particles

BOTTOM LEFT - "CANCÚN":
- Magnet glowing with cyan (#09adc2) energy
- Turquoise water splashing outward
- A manta ray gliding out, elegant
- Beach sand particles and seashells floating
- Cyan energy particles

BOTTOM RIGHT - "OAXACA":
- Magnet glowing with orange (#f39223) energy
- Colorful alebrije (Mexican folk art creature) emerging - fantastical, painted patterns
- Marigold flower petals (cempasúchil) floating outward
- Mezcal agave leaves trailing
- Orange and red energy particles

INTERACTION BETWEEN PORTALS:
- The energy streams from each magnet INTERTWINE in the center
- Where green, cyan, and orange meet: white light, special moment
- Particles from all three mixing in the middle space
- Creates a sense of connected magic

DEPTH:
- Each magnet at slightly different Z-depth
- Yucatan slightly further back, Cancun and Oaxaca forward
- This creates dynamic tension

LIGHTING:
- Each magnet is its own light source (its brand color)
- Dramatic rim lighting on all elements
- The three colors illuminate the fog/atmosphere differently

TEXT:
"CADA DESTINO. SU PROPIA MAGIA."
"Colección completa disponible"
AXKAN logo

This shows the SYSTEM - multiple destinations, same magic, coherent brand.


================================================================================
SLIDE 6: THE CRAFT - "DESCOMPOSICIÓN DETAIL"
================================================================================
Format: 1080x1350 portrait
Purpose: Appreciation of quality, "This is premium"

PROMPT:
--------
Extreme macro product photography, 1080x1350 portrait, luxury detail shot.

TIGHT CROP: Extreme close-up on a magnet surface - we see only about 30% of the full magnet, massively enlarged.

FOCUS AREA: The junction where a colorful letter meets the illustrated jungle and the wood edge - showing three materials/textures meeting.

VISIBLE DETAILS AT MACRO SCALE:

The letter "Y" (from YUCATAN):
- Hot pink (#e72a88) with Mayan geometric pattern inside
- At this scale, see the precision of the pattern lines
- Subtle texture of the printing/paint
- The edge where color meets background

The illustrated jaguar fur (partial):
- Brushstroke texture visible if illustrated
- Or print dot pattern if printed
- Individual spots have depth

The MDF wood edge:
- Dramatic wood grain texture
- Individual fibers visible
- The warm tan color (#D4A574)
- Shows this is REAL material, not plastic

The tropical leaf illustration:
- Where green meets other colors
- The layering of elements

LIGHTING:
- Dramatic RAKING LIGHT from left side
- Creates long shadows across the surface texture
- Every tiny imperfection and detail revealed
- Golden warm light suggesting quality

DEPTH OF FIELD:
- Ultra shallow - only a thin band in perfect focus
- Background and foreground fall into creamy bokeh
- Creates that luxury product photography feel

ATMOSPHERE:
- Subtle dust particles caught in the light beam
- Warmth and craftsmanship feeling

TEXT (minimal, elegant):
Small, bottom corner:
"Detalle artesanal"
"Hecho en México"
AXKAN logo tiny

This slide says: "We care about every millimeter." It's the luxury brand detail shot.


================================================================================
SLIDE 7: THE CALL - BRAND CLOSER
================================================================================
Format: 1080x1350 portrait
Purpose: Close the loop, clear CTA, brand memory

PROMPT:
--------
Bold brand statement, 1080x1350 portrait, clean and powerful.

BACKGROUND:
Solid hot pink (#e72a88) - the primary brand color, owning the space.

Subtle texture: The AXKAN brand pattern (flowers, spirals, leaves, jaguar elements) embossed/debossed into the pink at 5% opacity - barely visible but adds depth. Like luxury wallpaper.

CENTER TOP:
The full AXKAN logo - the decorative jaguar with geometric Mayan patterns, and below it the stylized "AXKAN" letters with cultural textures inside each letter.

The logo has a subtle glow effect - soft white outer glow suggesting the portal magic from previous slides.

BELOW LOGO:
"RECUERDOS HECHOS SOUVENIR"
In white, clean condensed font (Prenton RP Cond), tracked out slightly.

BELOW TAGLINE (smaller):
"Portales a México para tu hogar"

BOTTOM SECTION:
Clean white text:
→ www.axkan.com
→ @axkan.mx
"Envíos a todo México y USA"

SUBTLE MAGIC:
At the very bottom corners, barely visible:
- Tiny hints of the portal energy (faint cyan wisps on left, faint orange wisps on right)
- A few floating particles
- Suggesting the magic continues beyond the frame

OVERALL FEEL:
Confident. Bold. Premium. The brand stands alone after proving itself in slides 1-6.

This is the "remember us" slide. Pink burns into memory.
