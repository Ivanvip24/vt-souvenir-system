## POST 3: Educational List Post (3 images)

### Image 3-1: Hero/Comparison (Large Left)

```
Bold conceptual image for LinkedIn showing contrast between generic vs premium Mexican souvenirs.

COMPOSITION: Split image diagonal divide.

LEFT SIDE (40%): Dull, grey-toned pile of cheap, generic plastic souvenirs - tacky sombreros, identical mass-produced keychains, faded colors, visible cheap plastic texture. Slightly out of focus, desaturated, unappealing lighting. Represents the "wrong way."

RIGHT SIDE (60%): Vibrant, colorful premium AXKAN-style MDF magnets beautifully arranged. Sharp focus, rich colors (pink #e72a88, green #8ab73b, orange #f39223, cyan #09adc2), visible quality wood edges (#D4A574), glossy professional finish. Represents the "right way."

DIAGONAL DIVIDE: Clean 45-degree angle separating the two sides, perhaps with a subtle pink (#e72a88) line along the divide.

LIGHTING: Deliberately bad flat lighting on left side, beautiful product photography lighting on right side.

STYLE: Conceptual comparison photography, before/after feeling. 8K quality on the "good" side.

ASPECT RATIO: 1200x627 pixels (horizontal, will be the large image in grid)

MOOD: Clear visual argument - the difference is obvious
